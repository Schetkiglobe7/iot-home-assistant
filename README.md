# IoT Home Assistant - A Modular and Replicable IoT System

Welcome to the **IoT Home Assistant** project! This open-source initiative leverages the power of **Home Assistant**, **Docker**, and a scalable architecture to provide an easily replicable IoT system for managing smart devices across multiple locations.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The IoT Home Assistant project is designed to serve as a **core IoT management system**, capable of controlling and monitoring devices in **distributed environments**. It focuses on modularity, portability, and ease of replication, making it suitable for deployment across **multiple locations** with minimal setup.

Key Features:
- **Home Assistant in Docker**: A containerized version of Home Assistant for seamless deployment.
- **Replicable Architecture**: Fully configurable via Docker volumes and `.env` files.
- **Distributed Databases**: Local databases at each site synchronize with a central shard database for redundancy and data integrity.
- **VPN Integration**: Ensures secure communication across multiple locations.
- **IoT Protocol Support**: Includes MQTT, Prometheus, and Grafana for device communication and monitoring.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Built-in pipelines for automated deployment and updates.

## 🛠️ Features and Functionality

1. **Home Assistant Core**: 
   - Centralized IoT management platform.
   - Easily extended with Home Assistant integrations for smart devices (lights, sensors, switches, etc.).
   
2. **Docker-Based Deployment**:
   - **Modular**: Each instance is deployed as a container.
   - **Persistent Configurations**: All settings are stored in Docker volumes for consistency across deployments.
   - **Scalability**: Easily replicate the system by cloning the repository and running `deploy.sh`.

3. **Data Redundancy and Sharding**:
   - **Local Databases**: Each site runs a local database for faster access and fault tolerance.
   - **Centralized Database**: Data from all sites is synchronized to a central database shard.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Integrated with **Grafana** and **Prometheus** for real-time data visualization and alerts.
   - Use MQTT for low-latency communication between devices.

5. **Security**:
   - VPN-based communication ensures secure data transfer across distributed systems.
   - Configurable authentication for all services.

## üìù Code Guidelines

To maintain code quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

### Coding Standards
- **Python**: Use [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines.
- Use `black` for formatting Python code:
  ```bash
  pip install black
  black .
  ```

### File Structure
- Place configuration files in the `config/` directory.
- Persistent data should be stored in `volumes/`.

### Writing Clean Commits
Write clear and concise commit messages:
- Use the format: `<type>(scope): <description>`.
  - Example: `feat(docker): add Docker Compose support`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.

### Testing
Before submitting, ensure:
- Your changes don‚Äôt break existing functionality.
- You‚Äôve tested your changes locally.
